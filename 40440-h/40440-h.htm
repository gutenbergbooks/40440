<h2>A DAY WITH BROWNING.</h2>

<p><img class="dropimg" src="images/illus004.jpg" width="125" height="166" alt="" /><br />
<b><span class="hide">F</span>ROM</b> his bed-room window in the Palazzo Giustiniani Recanati, every
morning in 1885, Robert Browning watched the sunrise. "My window
commands a perfect view," he wrote, "the still, grey lagoon, the few
seagulls flying, the islet of San Giorgio in deep shadow, and the
clouds in a long purple rack, from behind which a sort of spirit of
rose burns up, till presently all the rims are on fire with gold....
So my day begins."</p>

<p>The Palazzo, in which a suite of rooms had been placed by Mrs. Bronson
at the disposal of the poet and his sister, was a place of historical
association and fifteenth-century traditions. And no more appropriate
abiding-place than Venice could have been selected for a man of
Browning's temperament. The Venetian colouring was a perpetual feast
to his eye: its medi&aelig;val glories were a source of continual
inspiration. And if much of his heart<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> still remained with his native
land, so that the London daily papers were a necessity of existence,
and a certain sense of exile occasionally obtruded itself, we must
needs be grateful to that fact for its result in certain immortal
lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, to be in England<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now that April's there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whoever wakes in England<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sees, some morning, unaware,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the lowest boughs and the brush-wood sheaf<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round the elm-tree bole are in tiny leaf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the chaffinch sings on the orchard bough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In England&mdash;now!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And after April, when May follows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the whitethroat builds, and all the swallows!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hark! where my blossomed pear-tree in the hedge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leans to the field and scatters on the clover<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blossoms and dewdrops&mdash;at the bent-spray's edge&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That's the wise thrush; he sings each song twice over,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest you should think he never could recapture<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The first fine careless rapture!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though the fields look rough with hoary dew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All will be gay when noontide wakes anew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The buttercups, the little children's dower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Far brighter than this gaudy melon-flower!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But there had always been a frankly cosmopolitan spirit in
Browning,&mdash;no touch of parochialism or insularity. In the magnificent
gallery of portrait studies, no two alike, which his poems present to
us, the nationalities are legion. Yet Italian scenes predominate; for
Browning could gauge, with the unerring instinct of genius, all the
subtleties of the Italian temperament. So we come, at every turn,
across some ardent vision of the South,&mdash;here, Waring sailing out of
Trieste under the furled lateen-sail; and there, Fra Lippo Lippi
tracking "lutestrings, laughs, and whifts of song" down the darkling
streets of Florence. The "Patriot," riding into Brescia, "roses, roses
all the way," and the Duke of Ferrara,&mdash;that "typical representative
of a whole phase of civilisation," discussing <i>My Last Duchess</i> and
her foolishness.</p>

<span class="i0">Her husband's presence only, called that spot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of joy into the Duchess' cheek: perhaps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fr&agrave; Pandolf chanced to say "Her mantle laps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over my Lady's wrist too much," or "Paint<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must never hope to reproduce the faint<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half-flush that dies along her throat;" such stuff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For calling up that spot of joy. She had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A heart ... how shall I say? ... too soon made glad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too easily impressed; she liked whate'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Would draw from her alike the approving speech,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or blush, at least. She thanked men,&mdash;good; but thanked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Somehow ... I know not how ... as if she ranked<br /></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>After a light and early breakfast&mdash;the poet, when abroad, lived almost
entirely on milk, fruit, etc., abjuring animal food&mdash;Browning would
follow his invariable custom, a stroll along the Riva to the public
gardens. He never failed to leave the house at the same hour of the
day: he was a man of singularly methodical habits in many ways. "Good
sense," it has been said, "was his foible, if not his habit": and an
orderly method of life was one of the strongest proofs of this fact:
another evidence lay in his care to avoid being <i>labelled</i>. The
disorderly locks and careless appearance of the typical poet were
quite alien to this well-groomed, cleanly-looking Englishman, with his
"sweet, grave face," silvery hair, and smooth,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> healthy skin.
Singularly wholesome in body as well as in mind, until past seventy he
could take the longest walks without fatigue; the splendid eyesight of
his clear grey eyes remained untarnished to the last. These keen grey
eyes of his never failed to notice anything worth seeing in his walks:
an extraordinary minuteness of observation is perceptible in all his
poems dealing with out-door life,&mdash;little touches of detail such as
few men are masters of:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the leaf-buds on the vine are woolly,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I noticed that, to-day;<br /></span>

<span class="i4">&mdash;You know the red turns grey.<br /></span>
<span class="i14">(<i>The Lost Mistress.</i>)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And again, those lines of poignant, passionate reserve, which sum up
<i>May and Death</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I wish that when you died last May,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Charles, there had died along with you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three parts of spring's delightful things;<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Moon-births, and the long evening-ends.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, for their sake, be May still May!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Let their new time, as mine of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do all it did for me: I bid<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Sweet sights and sounds throng manifold.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Only, one little sight, one plant,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Woods have in May, that starts up green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save a sole streak which, so to speak,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Is spring's blood, spilt its leaves between,&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That, they might spare; a certain wood<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Might miss the plant; their loss were small:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I,&mdash;whene'er the leaf grows there,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Its drop comes from my heart, that's all.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Arrived at the public gardens, Browning was careful to visit his
"friends" there and to feed them&mdash;the elephant, baboon, kangaroo,
ostrich, pelican, and marmosets. He had that particular <i>camaraderie</i>
with wild animals which is almost akin to a hypnotic influence over
them: and when in the country, he would "whistle softly to the lizards
basking on the low walls which border the roads, to try his old power
of attracting them." Flowers he enjoyed as a colour-feast for the eye;
scenery he revelled in. In that perpetual contemplation of Nature,
which with Wordsworth became an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> all-absorbent passion, Browning had
but little share: his chief interest was in man. But "now and again
external nature was for him ... pierced and shot through with
spiritual fire."</p>

<p>Three times punctually he would walk round the gardens, and then walk
home. Upon these daily strolls he was accompanied by his sister
Sarianna: in whose love and companionship he was singularly fortunate.
Sarianna Browning had always been the best of sisters to the poet and
his wife,&mdash;a kindred spirit in every sense of the word; and she was
now intent to supply, so far as in her lay, the place of that "soul of
fire enclosed in a shell of pearl"&mdash;Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Of the
dead wife, who had been all-in-all to him, Browning seldom spoke in
words: but his burning need of her and hope of reunion with her
gleamed continually through his writings:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, their Rafael of the dear Madonnas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, their Dante of the dread Inferno,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrote one song&mdash;and in my brain I sing it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew one angel&mdash;borne, see, on my bosom!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And in all his poems which deal with the love of man and woman, "he
regarded the union of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> soul with soul as the capital achievement of
life." He thought of love "as a supreme possession in itself, and as a
revelation of infinite things which lie beyond it: as a test of
character, and even as a pledge of perpetual advance in the life of
the spirit." Hence, even where the shadow of death broods over a poem,
as we see it <i>In a Gondola</i>, that shadow "glows with colour like the
shadows of a Venetian painter." Love, to the very last, is infinitely
stronger than death.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The latter hours of the morning were devoted by the poet to work,
proof-sheets, and correspondence. He would complain bitterly of the
quantity of "ephemeral correspondence" which took up so much of his
time: yet, with the rarest exceptions, he answered every letter he
received. He counted that day lost in which he had not written at
least a little. In earlier life he had worked fast and copiously, but
now he was satisfied with twenty or thirty lines as the result of a
morning's work. And upon these lines he expended infinite trouble;
for, despite all suppositions to the contrary, he finished his work
with great care. "People accuse me of not taking pains!" he grumbled,
"I take nothing <i>but</i> pains!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>His subject-matter fell naturally into three groups of poems: those
interpreting love in its various phases, those occupied with art and
artists, those treating of religious ideas and emotions. And these
again may be subdivided into poems of failure and attainment: it is
hard to say which are which, for Browning was the singer of heroic
failures, and they, to him, were spiritual triumphs. He held that "we
fall to rise&mdash;are baffled to fight better,&mdash;sleep, to wake." No such
moral tonic has ever been proffered to the weary and dispirited as the
invulnerable optimism of Browning. He regarded this present life as a
state of probation and preparation; therefore, "his faith in the
unseen order of things created a hope which persists through all
apparent failure." The Miltonic ideal, "and what is else, not to be
overcome," is the core and centre of Browning's teaching. Sometimes it
refers to hopeless love, as in <i>The Last Ride Together</i>.</p>

<p>... At noon, Browning would make a second and more substantial
breakfast on Italian dishes; and at three o'clock regularly, a
friend's gondola, which was always at hand to convey him, came and
carried him, usually, to the Lido,&mdash;his favourite spot. "I walk, even
in wind or rain," he wrote, "for a couple of hours on Lido, and enjoy
the break of sea on the strip of sand, as much as Shelley did in those
old days.... Go there,&mdash;if only to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> blown about by the sea-wind!"
The sea-wind, indeed, was the very utterance of his own robust and
vigorous nature, his keen alertness of sense, and his impetuous,
impulsive spirit.</p>

<p>In the course of the afternoon, he would explore Venice in all
directions, studying her multitudinous points of interest and beauty.
The daughter of his hostess, Mrs. Bronson, sometimes companioned him
on these excursions, guiding him through the narrow by-streets, or
examining, with him, the monuments, sculptures and frescoes of the
churches.</p>

<p>Art, in its various manifestations, had been a life-long study with
Browning. He took great delight in modelling in clay, and had for some
while studied sculpture under Story. He possessed the artistic
temperament&mdash;fiery, nervous, susceptible&mdash;in its sanest form: and not
only was he able to express all an artist's aims, ambitions, and
despairs, but to arrive in all his poems, at one point or other, at a
superb pictorial moment. Some of his lines are penetrated from end to
end with this remarkable pictorial quality: perhaps the most notable
example is <i>Love Among the Ruins</i>, with its triple contrast,&mdash;the
infinite calm of the pasture-lands prolonging themselves into the
sunset, the noise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> and vital movement which had filled the
now-vanished city,&mdash;and the lover, endeavouring to curb his impatience
for the one beloved face by dwelling on these outward things:</p>

<p>Another characteristic of Browning was his consummate comprehension of
artistic ideals, those of temperaments so opposite as Fra Lippo Lippi,
<i>Pictor Ignotus</i>, and that too-perfect painter Andrea del Sarto. His
poem on the last-named was written and forwarded to a friend, who had
begged him to procure a copy of the Pitti portrait of Del Sarto and
his wife. It tells far more than any portrait could: and expresses the
writer's doctrine that in art, as in life, the aspiration toward the
higher is greater than the achievement of the lower: "A man's reach
should exceed his grasp, or what's heaven for?" According to
Browning's belief, a soul's probation, its growth, its ultimate value,
lie mainly if not wholly in this choice between the high and the less
high.</p>

<p>Social intercourse occupied a large portion of the day. Browning
identified himself with the daily life of Venice, and, besides this,
English and American acquaintances were frequently in Venice: the
poet, his reputation now firmly established and extending, was sought
after by innumerable admirers. He was a man of great social charm,&mdash;a
brilliant talker, full of amusing anecdotes,&mdash;his memory for
historical incident was only paralleled by his immense literary
knowledge, upon which he drew for apt illustration. Yet he was
naturally a reticent man, of painfully nervous excitability; "nervous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
to such a degree," as he said of himself, "that I might fancy I could
not enter a drawing-room, did I not know from my experience that I
<i>could</i> do it." This very nervousness, however, often induced an
almost abnormal vivacity of speech: and Browning was warmly welcomed
amongst the notable and even royal folk whose names were included in
Mrs. Bronson's circle; they recognised in him, as Frederick Tennyson
had done, "a man of infinite learning, jest, and <i>bonhomie</i>, and
moreover a sterling heart that reveals no hollowness." To women he was
specially attracted, and <i>vice-vers&acirc;</i>; "that golden-hearted Robert,"
as his wife had termed him, had an intimate understanding of the
woman's mind. But towards children, he was, so to speak, almost numb.
Devoted though he was to his only son, "the essential quality of early
childhood was not that which appealed to him:" and the fervour of
parental instinct finds practically no expression in his poems.</p>

<p>In the course of the day the poet would lose no opportunity of hearing
any important concert: an accomplished musician himself, his love for
the tone-art amounted to a passion: and in many of his greatest poems,
he had voiced the most secret meanings of music, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> the yearning
aspirations of a composer. We "sit alone in the loft" with the
organist, Master Hughes of Saxe-Gotha, and his "huge house of the
sounds," to listen and wonder while his fugue "broadens and thickens,
greatens and deepens and lengthens," and the intricacy of constructive
technique forms, as someone has said, "an interposing web spun by the
brain between art and things divine." Or we stand with Abt Vogler in
his "palace of music" as it falls to pieces, and the magic of
inspiration over-rides the mastery of construction. The void of the
silence is filled with "the substance of things hoped for; the
evidence of things not seen," and faith is born of the composer's very
impotence to realize the heights of his own ambition&mdash;yet one more
rendering of that triumphant failure, of which Browning was the
prophet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All we have willed or hoped or dreamed of good shall exist;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Not its semblance, but itself; no beauty, nor good, nor power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose voice has gone forth, but each survives for the melodist<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
<span class="i4">When eternity affirms the conception of an hour.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The high that proved too high, the heroic for earth too hard,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The passion that left the ground to lose itself in the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are music sent up to God by the lover and the bard;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Enough that he heard it once: we shall hear it by-and-by.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And what is our failure here but a triumph's evidence<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For the fulness of the days? Have we withered or agonized?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why else was the pause prolonged but that singing might issue thence?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Why rushed the discords in but that harmony should be prized?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sorrow is hard to bear, and doubt is slow to clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Each sufferer says his say, his scheme of the weal and woe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But God has a few of us whom he whispers in the ear;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The rest may reason and welcome: 'tis we musicians know.<br /></span>
<span class="i20">(<i>Abt Vogler.</i>)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And, as a final contrast, drawn out of that shoreless sea of contrasts
which music can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> reveal, we have <i>A Toccata of Galuppi's</i>, suffused
with the melancholy of mundane pleasure, steeped in the ephemeral
voluptuousness of eighteenth-century Venice. In these lines, it has
been pointed out, "Browning's self-restraint is admirable.... The poet
will not say a word more than the musician has said in his Toccata."</p>

</div></div>

<p>The afternoon wore by quickly, and it was soon time to dress for
dinner: for Browning was precise in adhering to the customs of
civilised life: and he liked to see his sister seated opposite him,
clad in beautiful gowns of sombre richness, and wearing quaint old
jewelry. Browning accepted his meals with frank pleasure; he was no
ascetic, and "his optimism and his belief in direct Providence led him
to make a direct virtue of happiness," and to welcome it in its
simplest form. Any guest who might be present was privileged to enjoy
that sparkling and many-faceted eloquence to which reference has been
made already. But the host was always careful to avoid deep or solemn
topics&mdash;doubtless because he felt them far too keenly, to use them as
mere texts for dinner-table discussion. "If such were broached<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> in his
presence, he dismissed them with one strong convincing sentence, and
adroitly turned the current of conversation into a shallower channel."</p>

<p>Later on, he would probably visit the Goldoni Theatre, where he had a
large box: or, if remaining at home, he was often prevailed upon to
read aloud. His delivery was forcible and dramatic,&mdash;he would strongly
emphasise all the light and shade of a poem, and the touches of
character in the dialogue. Especially was this the case when reading
his own compositions. But often he would say with a smile, "No R. B.
to-night!&mdash;let us have some real poetry," and would take down a volume
of Shelley, Keats or Coleridge.</p>

<p>At last, another of the "divine sunsets" which Browning adored had
faded over the Lido; the "quiet-coloured end of evening" had darkened
into dusk and stars. Even that alert and indefatigable frame grew
weary with the day's long doings, and a natural desire for rest
descended upon "the brain which too much thought expands." The vision
of Guercino's picture, "fraught with a pathos so magnificent,"
returned upon him from that sultry day in which he had beheld the
"Guardian Angel" at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> Fano, "my angel with me, too," and he longed for
the touch of those divinely-healing hands.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Thou bird of God! And wilt thou bend me low<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like him, and lay, like his, my hands together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lift them up to pray, and gently tether<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Me, as thy lamb there, with thy garments spread?...<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How soon all worldly wrong would be repaired!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I think how I should view the earth and skies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sea, when once again my brow was bared<br /></span>
<span class="i2">After thy healing, with such different eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O world, as God has made it! all is beauty:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knowing this, is love, and love is duty.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What further may be sought for or declared?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Yet it was not to a celestial visitant that Browning's thoughts turned
most, now or at any other time. It was towards the one love of his
life,&mdash;towards that re-union, that restoration, that infrangible joy
of retrieval, which was the goal of his whole desire. And,
characteristically of the man who was "ever a fighter," he did not
expect to reach his haven by a calm and prosperous passage. It had to
be fought for&mdash;struggled for from strength to strength,&mdash;attained
through incessant and arduous combat.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> For those do not "mount, and
that hardly, to eternal life," who remain content upon terrestrial
planes;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Surely they see not God, I know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor all that chivalry of His,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soldier-saints, who, row on row,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burn upwards each to his point of bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since, the end of life being manifest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had cut his way through the world to this."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Therefore, as sleep, "Death's twin-brother," came slowly through the
darkness, the fighter faced his last hour in imagination, and made
haste to "greet the future with a cheer." For <i>Prospice</i> is an "act of
the faith which comes through love.... No lonely adventure is here to
reward the victor o'er death: the transcendant joy is human love
recovered":</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fear death?&mdash;to feel the fog in my throat,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">The mist in my face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the snows begin, and the blasts denote<br /></span>
<span class="i8">I am nearing the place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The power of the night, the press of the storm,<br /></span>
